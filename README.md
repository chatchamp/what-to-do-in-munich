- Visit a beer garden in the summer. While the food at the bigger ones is not always the best, the atmosphere of the huge beergardens can be very cozy ("gemütlich") and relaxing. Biergarten am chinesischen Turm (https://goo.gl/maps/PxmbKVe4ZcEi1ZQR8) and Augustinerkeller (https://goo.gl/maps/6dXGcTPQc7KhDxdx7) are good ones. Very good food is available e.g. in a smaller one called Biergarten am Muffatwerk (https://goo.gl/maps/X5knn6ajkSobYxgu9).

- Visit Werksviertel (https://werksviertel-mitte.de/). Our former Chatchamp office was there, there is quite some good food (mostly lunch places), very good ice cream and the history of this upcoming district in Munich is very interesting. It used to be the biggest party area in Europe.

## where to party

- Kennedy's Munich (https://goo.gl/maps/QoNtYGmAynNmQB168): Good Irish pub with live bands and a quite iternational crowd.
